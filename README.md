# SWI-Prolog code re-indentation

These  programs  have  been  used  to  change  the  indentation  of  the
SWI-Prolog libraries from tabs to spaces, change the leading indentation
to 4 spaces and put cuts on their own line.

This code is not  a  generic  application,   but  it  does  contain some
reusable code that can be  useful   for  automatic indentation of Prolog
code.
